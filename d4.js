*/

Data type it is what kind of data that can be store and manipulate with java script 
 
    jaascript data types include:-Number Data type
                                 -String  Data type

/* EXERCISE 3

console.log(12 + 20)

/* EXERCISE 4
 Create a variable named x and assign to it the number 12.
*/

let x = 12

/* EXERCISE 5

*/

let name = "Humura"
/* EXERCISE 6
 Execute a subtraction between the number 4 and the variable x you declared before (which is storing the value 12).
*/

console.log( 4 - x)

/* EXERCISE 7
Create two variables: name1 and name2. Assign to name1 the string "john", and to name2 the string "John" (this one has a capital J!)
 Verify that name1 is different from name2 (HINT: check their equality to be false).
 Finally, verify that the equality between name1 and name2 becomes true if both are lowercase (without changing the value of name2).
 YOU DON'T NEED AN IF/ELSE BLOCK. It is enough to use console.log()
*/

let name1 = "john"
let name2 = "John"

console.log(name1 === name2)
console.log(name1 !== name2)

/* WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED
